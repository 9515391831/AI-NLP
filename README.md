<h1><center>NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING</center></h1>

Natural Language Processing is the technology used to aid computers to
understand the humanâ€™s natural language like English. The objective of NLP
is to read, understand, and make sense of the human languages.
NLP techniques rely on machine learning to derive meaning from human
languages.
